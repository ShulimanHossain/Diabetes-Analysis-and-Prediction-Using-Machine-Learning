#  Diabetes Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

---

##  Introduction

This is a practice project focused on applying Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to the problem of diabetes prediction.  
The project uses a publicly available dataset obtained from Kaggle that simulates real-world medical and lifestyle data.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and supervised classification models, the goal is to strengthen practical skills in:
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature analysis  
- Healthcare-focused predictive modeling

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was collected from Kaggle.

- **Name:** Diabetes Prediction Dataset  
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset 

---

## 📁 Project Overview

The dataset contains demographic, medical, and lifestyle information used to predict whether an individual has diabetes.

---

## 🧾 Features Description

- **gender** : Gender of the individual  
- **age** : Age of the individual  
- **hypertension** : Indicates whether the individual has hypertension  
  *(0 = No, 1 = Yes)*  
- **heart_disease** : Indicates whether the individual has heart disease  
  *(0 = No, 1 = Yes)*  
- **smoking_history** : Smoking history of the individual  
- **bmi** : Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- **HbA1c_level** : Average blood sugar level over the past 2–3 months  
- **blood_glucose_level** : Current blood glucose level  
- **diabetes** : Target variable  
  *(0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)*

## 🎯 Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning classification models that can accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes based on medical and lifestyle features.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**

Special attention is given to **recall**, as false negatives can be critical in healthcare applications.
